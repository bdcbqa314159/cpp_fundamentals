# Chapter 1

## Compilation Model
We saw the importance of include guards, the process of compilation and how to write a simple executable and compile it.
The first exercise was not done as I use Makefile and CMake commands to compile c++ code.

## Built-in Data Types
We saw the basics of primitive data types, the data types modifiers and variable definition with some naming conventions.
Two new types of initialisation has been covered:
'''
auto variable_name = value;

type variable1;
decltype(variable1) variable2;
'''

Note that the auto keyword needs an initialisation.
