# Chapter 2 - Functions

## Introduction
We introduce the concept of function within the creation of a software.

## Function Declaration and Definition

```cpp
// Declaration: function without body
return_type function_name( parameter list );
```

## Defining a Function

```cpp
// Definition: function with body
  return_type function_name( parameter_list ) {
    statement1;
    statement2;
  ...
    last statement;
}
```

## Local and Global Variables
We saw two types of variables and we have some experience on how to use them.
Note that const must go along a global variable.

## Working with Variable objects
We saw how the scope of a variable tied up with its lifetime during the execution of the program and the order of declaration has an impact on the order of destruction of every single data created within the scope of the whole program.
